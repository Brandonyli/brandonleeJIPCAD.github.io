JIPCAD (Joint-Interactive-Procedural CAD) is an emerging new Computer-Aided-Design tool being developed by Professor Carlo Sequin and a team of undergraduate and graduate researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. The project was originally named NOME3 (Non-Orientable Manifold Editor).

This repository serves to host the files of my contributions to the JIPCAD project. The narrated Github Page is at https://brandonleeJIPCAD.github.io/. The main development repository for the JIPCAD project is at https://github.com/randyfan/NOME3.
